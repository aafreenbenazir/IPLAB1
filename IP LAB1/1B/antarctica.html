    Antarctica, the southernmost continent and site of 
    the South Pole, is a virtually uninhabited, ice-covered 
    landmass. Most cruises to the continent visit the 
    Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches toward South 
    America. It’s known for the Lemaire Channel and 
    Paradise Harbor, striking, iceberg-flanked passageways, 
    and Port Lockroy, a former British research station 
    turned museum. The peninsula’s isolated terrain 
    also shelters rich wildlife, including many penguins.
